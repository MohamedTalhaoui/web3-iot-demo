# web3-iot-demo
This is a all-in-one repository to set up a very simple demo showing how to use blockchain and IoT for parametric insurance.
The scenario is the following
- Let the audience subscribe your insurance policy using the DApp
- Heat the sensor to increase the mesured temperature above the threshold
- Automatic payout is triggered, the audience are getting some ether back

## Pre-requisite
We will be using Ethereum Rinkeby test network.
### Metamask
Install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
Switch to the Rinkeby network

### Claim some Ethers
You will need some ether to play with. You can get some from [here](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

### Remix IDE
Remix IDE is a web based IDE to develop, compile, deploy, interact and debug your smart contracts. 
https://remix.ethereum.org
Note: Remix IDE works better with Google Chrome

### Etherscan
Etherscan allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum.
We will use the Rinkeby variant https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/

## IOT

### RaspberryPi
#### Hardware
DHT 22
\RaspberryPi 3 B+

#### Wiring

#### Code

## Samrt Contract
Use Google Chrome

### Install Metamask
### Prepare RemixIDE
### Compile your contract
### Deploy your contract

## Decentralized Application (DApp)
This is a simple web application to interact with the smart contract to subscribe your insurance policy
It is hosted on GitHub pages and reachable from https://mohamedtalhaoui.github.io/web3-iot-demo/
The source code is available under dapp directory

If you plan to deploy your own smart contract, then you will have to 
 - update the abi.json file
 - update the app.js file to provide your smart contract address

## Utils
Mainly for debugging purposes
Might be use with a Rapsberry Pi

## Deep Dive
TBD
